# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
-- From the following tables, write a SQL query to determine the commission of the salespeople in Paris. Return commission.

```sql
-- select commission from salesman 
WHERE salesman_id IN (
select salesman_id 
from customer 
where city = 'Paris');
```

**Question 2**
---
-- Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.
```sql
-- select student_name, grade 
from GRADES 
WHERE grade = (
select max(grade)
from GRADES as g
where g.subject = GRADES.subject);
```

from orders 
WHERE salesman_id IN (
select distinct salesman_id 
from orders 
where customer_id = 3007);
```
