# Experiment 6: Joins

## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**
--
-- Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the first name from the "patients" table (aliased as "patient_name") and the first name from the "doctors" table (aliased as "doctor_name"), with an inner join on the "doctor_id" column and a condition filtering for patients with a date of birth after '1990-01-01'.

```sql
-- SELECT p.first_name AS patient_name, d.first_name AS doctor_name 
FROM PATIENTS p 
INNER JOIN DOCTORS d
ON p.doctor_id = d.doctor_id 
WHERE p.discharge_date > '1990-01-01';
```

**Question 2**
---
-- Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the first name from the "patients" table and all columns from the "surgeries" table, with an inner join on the "patient_id" column.

```sql
-- select p.first_name, s.surgery_id, p.patient_id, s.surgeon_id, s.surgery_date

INNER JOIN SURGERIES s 
ON p.patient_id = s.patient_id
